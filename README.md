**Deck-Ify is a fast, lightweight and performant modpack made for the Steam Deck running on the Fabric Loader.**

# ðŸš€ Performance is the priority

Deck-Ify is based on making performance as good as possible, whilst adding QoL specifically for the Steam Deck, it is tinkered specifically for the usage case of the Steam Deck's models.
<p/> If you are not using a Steam Deck or a similar handheld, I disadvise using this modpack due to how its configurations are probably not built properly for your system.

It intends to give better performance than its competitors, whilst lacking the bloat that some of them provide.

Deck-Ify make rendering much better via mods like [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), optimize memory usage with mods such as [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core) and [ModernFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernfix). Deck-Ify attempts to keep 100% vanilla parity.

# âž• Features
- Amazing performance (A stable 60 FPS on my LCD model)
- An easy to use and configure controller implementation
- Incredibly lightweight to save on your storage space
- Optifine parity


# ðŸ“¦ Additional Features
Nitrogen also has QoL features tinkered for the Steam Deck in particular.

This includes:
- Controller support using Controlify
- Community based translations (Contribute at the [Loqui Website!](https://loqui.imb11.dev/))
- Bugfixes for the base game that may otherwise be inconvienent or annoying
- Input fixes
- Small visual fixes (via mods such as [Model Gap Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modelfix))
- Shaders built in

Deck-Ify also includes only **Open Source** or **Source Visible** mods. Feel free to contribute to them all!
